"A Comparative Study of Deep Learning and Iterative Algorithms for Joint Channel Estimation and Signal Detection",  [arxiv:2303.03678](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03678)  


We evaluate three DL methods: [DeepRx](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9345504), a lightweight DenseNet adapted to JCESD, and
a new unrolled dynamics(UD) model called Hyper-WienerNet, which uses hypernetworks to estimate unknown
parameters.
